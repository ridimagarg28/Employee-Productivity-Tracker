# Employee Productivity Tracker using SQL

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and tracking employee productivity using SQL. The dataset consists of various employee performance metrics, including work hours, performance scores, promotions, and satisfaction levels. A **Productivity Scoring Model** was developed to rank employees into **High, Moderate, and Low Performers**, enabling data-driven decision-making for workforce management.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handled missing values, corrected data types, and ensured data integrity using SQL queries.
- **Productivity Scoring Model:** Implemented a weighted formula to calculate employee productivity based on multiple performance factors.
- **Ranking System:** Categorized employees as **High, Moderate, or Low Performers** based on their productivity scores.
- **Optimized Query Performance:** Used **indexing and efficient SQL queries** to improve query execution speed.
- 
## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Employee ID** (Unique identifier)
- **Department, Job Title** (Employee work details)
- **Performance Score, Satisfaction Score** (Work performance indicators)
- **Work Hours per Week, Overtime Hours** (Workload tracking)
- **Promotions, Sick Days, Resignation Status** (Employee progress tracking)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** ‚Äì Data storage, cleaning, transformation, and analytics.

## üìñ SQL Implementation Steps
1. **Database & Table Creation:** Created the `Raw_Employees` table and defined appropriate data types.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized column values, removed duplicates, and fixed data inconsistencies.
3. **Computed Productivity Score:** Used a weighted formula incorporating multiple performance metrics.
4. **Implemented Ranking System:** Classified employees into performance categories based on computed scores.
5. **Query Optimization:** Utilized indexing for efficient querying.

## üìä Productivity Score Formula
```sql
UPDATE Raw_Employees
SET Productivity_Score =  
    (Performance_Score * 3 +  
     Employee_Satisfaction_Score * 1.5 +  
     Work_Hours_Per_Week * 1 -  
     Sick_Days * 10 +  
     Promotions * 1.5 -  
     Overtime_Hours * 6);
```

## üî• Key Insights
- Identified top-performing employees based on calculated **Productivity Scores**.
- Analyzed trends in **work hours, performance, and employee satisfaction**.
- Helped in workforce optimization by identifying areas for **improvement and training**.

## üìå How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-Productivity-Tracker.git
   ```
2. **Import the Dataset** into MySQL Workbench.
3. **Run SQL Queries** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
4. **Visualize Results** using Tableau for better insights.

## üèÜ Future Enhancements
- Automate data updates using stored procedures.
- Implement a **real-time dashboard** for monitoring employee performance.
- Integrate with **HR systems** for better workforce planning.
